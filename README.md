# Real Estate Prediction Application

This application predicts real estate prices using a machine learning model. The backend is built with Python (using a framework like Flask or Django) and leverages Apache or another web server to serve the frontend. The frontend is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript combination that interacts with the backend API for predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to input property details
- Real-time prediction of estimated property price
- Responsive design for various devices

## Prerequisites

- Python (version >= 3.7)
- pip (Python package installer)
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) - Installation instructions vary depending on your operating system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yuvraj004/real_estate_prediction.git
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd real_estate_prediction/server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   Note: Replace `requirements.txt` with the actual filename containing your backend dependencies.

3. Set up your web server (Apache or similar):

    - Refer to your web server's documentation for specific configuration steps.
    - Ensure the server can access the backend application (usually within the backend folder).

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

   - Run the Python script that initiates the Flask/Django application (e.g., `python app.py`).

2. Restart your web server (if necessary):

   - Some web server configurations might require a restart after making changes.

3. (Optional) Configure Apache Virtual Hosts (if applicable):

   - If using Apache, you might need to create a virtual host configuration to point to the backend application directory.

4. Access the application in your web browser:

   - Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) (or the appropriate URL based on your web server setup) in your browser.

## Deployment

- Instructions for deployment depend on your chosen platform (e.g., cloud hosting, on-premises server).
- Generally, you'll need to copy the backend application and configure your web server on the deployment environment.

## Contributing

- We welcome contributions! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements.

## Additional Notes

- The specific backend framework (Flask or Django) might require adjustments in these instructions.
- This is a basic setup for a model prediction application. You'll need to implement the prediction logic in the backend and provide an interface in the frontend to interact with the API.
